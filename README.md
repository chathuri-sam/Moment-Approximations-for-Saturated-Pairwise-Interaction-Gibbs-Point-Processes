## üìò Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis associated with a study on **Poisson Saddlepoint Approximation** methods for the moments of the **Saturated Pairwise Interaction Gibbs Point Process (SPIGPP)**.

The project introduces an efficient approximation technique for the intensity and K-function of SPIGPP models. The methods are validated using simulation studies to demonstrate accuracy and practical utility.

For detailed results, please refer to the [pre-print]( ).
